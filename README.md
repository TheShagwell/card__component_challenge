## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

I learnt various techniques to build a project with flexbox using the display: flex and its other properties and also centering the div. Styling the mobile responsiveness at first was a bit ouuccch! but i came through

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

## Snippets of the UI used

```html
    <div class="styled__component__card__image">
        <img src="/img/image-header-desktop.jpg" alt="mobile--desktop" class="desktop--image">
        <img src="/img/image-header-mobile.jpg" alt="mobile--image" class="mobile--image">
    </div>

```
```css
  .styled__component__card__image img{
     width: 100%;
     display: block;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks](https://www.css-tricks.com) - This helped me for Flexbox reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
